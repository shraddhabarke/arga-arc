Now I will show you some example programs in the DSL.

The following program recolors all the objects to color Y:
```
(do
    (rule
        (filter)
        (apply
            (update_color Y)
        )
    )
)
```

The following program recolors the 3 smallest objects of color X to colors Y, F and A, in that order:
```
(do
    (rule
        (filter
            (and
                (filter_by_color X)
                (filter_by_size min)
            )
        )
        (apply
            (update_color Y)
        )
    )
    (rule
        (filter
            (and
                (filter_by_color X)
                (filter_by_size min)
            )
        )
        (apply
            (update_color F)
        )
    )
    (rule
        (filter
            (and
                (filter_by_color X)
                (filter_by_size min)
            )
        )
        (apply
            (update_color A)
        )
    )
)
```

The following program first recolors all objects to color R, then recolors all the objects of size 1 to color R:
```
(do
    (rule
        (filter)
        (apply
            (update_color R)
        )
    )
    (rule
        (filter
            (filter_by_size 1)
        )
        (apply
            (update_color R)
        )
    )
)
```

The following program selects all objects that have a neighbor of size 4 in a diagonal direction, and moves them toward that neighbor:
```
(do
    (rule
        (filter
            (varand
                (is_diagonal_neighbor)
                (filter_by_size 4)
            )
        )
        (apply
            (move_node_max var)
        )
    )
)
```

The following program selects all objects of size 1 that have a neighbor or color X, and extends them toward that neighbor:
```
(do
    (rule
        (filter
            (and
                (filter_by_size 1)
                (varand
                    (is_any_neighbor)
                    (filter_by_color X)
                )
            )
        )
        (apply
            (extend_node var false)
        )
    )
)
```

The following program has 2 rules.
First, it selects all objects of size 1 that have a horizontal or vertical neighbor of color X, and for each such object, it recolors it to color R and moves it down.
Then, it selects all objects of size 1 that have a horizontal or vertical neighbor of color Y, and for each such object, it recolors it to color B and moves it up.
```
(do
    (rule
        (filter
            (and
                (filter_by_size 1)
                (varand
                    (is_direct_neighbor)
                    (filter_by_color X)
                )
            )
        )
        (apply
            (update_color R)
            (move_node_max D)
        )
    )
    (rule
        (filter
            (and
                (filter_by_size 1)
                (varand
                    (is_direct_neighbor)
                    (filter_by_color Y)
                )
            )
        )
        (apply
            (update_color B)
            (move_node_max U)
        )
    )
)
```
