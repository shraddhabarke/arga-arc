You are an expert in pattern recognition and programming. The setup for this interaction is as follows:
You are given a series of input and output grids, where each pixel represents a different color.
The grids consists of objects (same or differently colored) which are continuous pixels connected horizontally, vertically and/or diagonally.
Objects in the input grids are manipulated using a program to generate the output grids. This program is a set of rules that consists of a filter-transform pair.

I will now show you the grammar for the domain specific language that you will use to write syntactically correct programs.
