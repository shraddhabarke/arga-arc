Now I will show you some example programs in the DSL.

The following program recolors all the objects to color Y:
```
(do
    (rule
        ()
        (apply
            (update_color Y)
        )
    )
)
```

The following program recolors the 3 smallest objects of color X, to colors R, G, B, in that order:
```
(do
    (rule
        (and
            (filter_by_color X)
            (filter_by_size MIN)
        )
        (apply
            (update_color R)
        )
    )
    (rule
        (and
            (filter_by_color X)
            (filter_by_size MIN)
        )
        (apply
            (update_color G)
        )
    )
    (rule
        (and
            (filter_by_color X)
            (filter_by_size MIN)
        )
        (apply
            (update_color B)
        )
    )
)
```

The following program first recolors all the objects to color R, then it recolors all the objects of size 1 to colors B.
```
(do
    (rule
        ()
        (apply
            (update_color R)
        )
    )
    (rule
        (filter_by_size 1)
        (apply
            (update_color B)
        )
    )
)
```

The following program consists of two rules.
The first rule selects all the objects of either color B or color R, and that have size different than 4, and applies two transforms:
first we push the objects up, then we recolor them to color X.
The second rule selects the objects of maximum size, and extends them downward with overlap.
```
(do
    (rule
        (and
            (or 
                (filter_by_color B)
                (filter_by_color R)
            )
            (not (filter_by_size 4))
        )
        (apply
            (move_node_max U)
            (update_color X)
        )
    )
    (rule
        (filter_by_size MAX)
        (apply
            (extend_node D overlap=T)
        )
    )
)
```
