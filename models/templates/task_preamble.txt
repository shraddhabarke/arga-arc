Now we continue with the visual perception and reasoning task.
The input for the task is a small number of pairs of grids of characters.
The values of the grids are the colors defined in the DSL, so we can think of grids as images.
Each pair of images correspond to an input output example for an unknown program P.
The program P is evaluated on the input and operates on the objects that appear in it.
The output of the program is the output image.
The objects in the image are easy and natural to identify for humans, so there is no need to define them explicitly.
However you are able to abstract them correctly, and the DSL is interpreted with the same correct abstraction.

After you have seen all the examples, you are asked to write the program P.

Here are the input output examples for the task, as well as inputs for other test cases:
