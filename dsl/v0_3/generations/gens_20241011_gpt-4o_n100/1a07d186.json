we continue with the visual perception and reasoning task.\nThe input for the task is a small number of pairs of grids of characters.\nThe value of each of the cells of the grids are the colors defined in the DSL, so we can think of grids as images.\nEach pair of images correspond to an input-output example for an unknown program P.\nFor each pair, the program P is evaluated on the image grid and operates on the objects that appear in it.\nThe output of the program is then the output image.\nThe objects in the images are easy and natural to identify for humans, so there is no need to define them explicitly.\nHowever you are able to abstract them correctly, and the DSL is interpreted with the same correct abstraction.\n\n\nNow I will show you some demonstration tasks along with the output you would be expected to produce for each of them.\n\n## DEMONSTRATION TASK 1\n\n### INPUT\nPAIR 1\nINPUT GRID:\nO O O O O O O O\nO O O O O R O O\nO R O O O R O R\nO R R O O R O O\nO O O O O O
